Filters work on the row level—they allows you to return rows that
only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for
queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that
returns a table response).
